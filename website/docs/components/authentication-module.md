# Authentication Module

The Authentication Module is a core component of the OpenZTNA Client Connector that verifies user identity and establishes secure access to enterprise resources.

## Role in Endpoint Protection

The Authentication Module serves as the first line of defense in the Zero Trust security model:

- **Identity Verification**: Ensures only authorized users can access resources
- **Access Foundation**: Provides the identity context for all access decisions
- **Credential Protection**: Securely handles authentication tokens
- **Session Security**: Maintains and verifies authentication state
- **Phishing Prevention**: Reduces credential theft risk through modern protocols

## Architecture

The Authentication Module uses a modular architecture to provide secure, flexible authentication:

+------------------------------------------+
```

### Core Components

#### Auth Protocol Handlers

The Auth Protocol Handlers implement various authentication protocols:

- **OAuth2 Handler**: Implements the OAuth2 authorization flow
- **OIDC Handler**: Extends OAuth2 with OpenID Connect capabilities
- **SAML Handler**: Implements SAML authentication (planned for future release)

These handlers ensure that authentication follows industry-standard protocols, reducing the risk of implementation vulnerabilities.

#### Token Manager

The Token Manager securely handles authentication tokens:

- **Token Storage**: Encrypts tokens at rest using platform-specific secure storage
- **Token Validation**: Verifies token integrity, expiration, and signature
- **Token Refresh**: Automatically refreshes tokens before expiration
- **Token Revocation**: Handles token invalidation when needed

The Token Manager prevents token theft and misuse, protecting the user's authenticated session.

#### Identity Provider Connectors

The Identity Provider Connectors integrate with various identity systems:

- **Generic OAuth2/OIDC**: Works with any standard OAuth2/OIDC provider
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Optimized for Microsoft identity services
- **Okta**: Specialized connector for Okta identity platform
- **Google Workspace**: Dedicated support for Google authentication

These connectors allow organizations to leverage their existing identity infrastructure.

#### Browser Integration

The Browser Integration component handles browser-based authentication flows:

- **Local Web Server**: Runs a local web server to receive authentication callbacks
- **Browser Launcher**: Opens the system browser for authentication
- **Headless Mode**: Supports authentication without a browser for automated environments
- **Session Capture**: Securely captures authentication responses

This component ensures a seamless authentication experience while maintaining security.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow in the OpenZTNA Client Connector follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: The client starts and checks for valid authentication tokens
2. **Authentication Request**: If no valid token exists, the client initiates authentication
3. **Browser Redirect**: The user is redirected to the identity provider's login page
4. **User Authentication**: The user authenticates with the identity provider
5. **Authorization**: The user authorizes the client to access resources
6. **Token Exchange**: The identity provider issues tokens to the client
7. **Token Storage**: The client securely stores the tokens
8. **Token Validation**: The client validates the tokens before use
9. **Token Refresh**: The client automatically refreshes tokens before expiration

This flow ensures continuous authentication while minimizing user disruption.

## Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication

The Authentication Module supports multi-factor authentication:

- **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**: Compatible with authenticator apps
- **Push Notifications**: Support for push-based approval
- **Biometric Authentication**: Integration with platform biometric capabilities
- **Hardware Security Keys**: Support for FIDO2/WebAuthn standards

MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

### Token Security

Authentication tokens are protected through multiple security measures:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Tokens are encrypted at rest using platform security features
  - Windows: Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)
  - macOS: Keychain
  - Linux: Secret Service API or encrypted file storage
  
- **Memory Protection**: In-memory tokens are protected against memory dumps
  - Memory is marked as non-pageable where possible
  - Tokens are cleared from memory when no longer needed
  - Sensitive memory is overwritten before release
  
- **Secure Transmission**: Tokens are only transmitted over secure channels
  - TLS 1.2+ for all communications
  - Certificate validation for all connections
  - Protection against downgrade attacks
  
- **Token Validation**: Tokens are validated for integrity and expiration
  - Signature verification
  - Expiration checking
  - Audience validation
  - Issuer validation

These measures create a comprehensive defense against token theft and misuse.

### PKCE Extension

The Authentication Module implements the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension:

- **Code Verifier Generation**: Creates a cryptographically random code verifier
- **Code Challenge Derivation**: Derives a code challenge using SHA-256
- **Challenge Verification**: Verifies the code challenge during token exchange

PKCE prevents authorization code interception attacks, protecting the authentication process.

### Session Management

Secure session management protects the authenticated state:

- **Session Monitoring**: Detects unusual session activity
- **Inactivity Timeout**: Automatically terminates inactive sessions
- **Forced Re-authentication**: Requires re-authentication for sensitive operations
- **Session Revocation**: Immediately terminates compromised sessions

These features ensure that authentication remains valid throughout the user's session.

## Integration with Other Components

The Authentication Module integrates with other components of the OpenZTNA Client Connector:

- **Device Assessment Engine**: Provides user identity for device assessment
  - Links device security state to user identity
  - Enables user-specific device security policies
  
- **Policy Enforcer**: Provides user identity for policy enforcement
  - Enables user-based access controls
  - Supports role-based access policies
  
- **Tunneling Module**: Provides authentication for tunnel establishment
  - Ensures only authenticated users can establish tunnels
  - Links tunnels to specific user identities
  
- **Local Proxy**: Provides authentication for application access
  - Attaches user identity to application requests
  - Enables application-level access controls

This integration ensures that user identity is consistently applied across all security functions.

## Deployment Considerations

### Enterprise Identity Integration

For enterprise deployments, consider these integration points:

- **Active Directory Integration**: Connect to on-premises AD through ADFS
- **Cloud Identity Providers**: Direct integration with cloud identity services
- **Federated Authentication**: Support for identity federation across providers
- **Legacy System Support**: Options for integrating with legacy authentication systems

### Authentication Policies

Configure authentication policies to balance security and usability:

- **Session Duration**: Set appropriate token lifetimes
- **MFA Requirements**: Define when MFA is required
- **Re-authentication Triggers**: Specify events that require re-authentication
- **Allowed Identity Providers**: Restrict which identity providers can be used

### High Availability

Ensure authentication remains available even during disruptions:

- **Offline Authentication**: Support for authentication when network connectivity is limited
- **Cached Tokens**: Secure storage of valid tokens for continued operation
- **Multiple Identity Providers**: Fallback options if primary provider is unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality mode when authentication is unavailable

## Troubleshooting

Common authentication issues and their solutions:

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Authentication fails | Invalid credentials, network issues, misconfigured client | Check credentials, network connection, and client configuration |
| Token refresh fails | Expired refresh token, revoked access | Re-authenticate with the identity provider |
| Browser doesn't open | Missing browser, permissions issues | Configure a custom browser or use headless mode |
| Callback fails | Port in use, network restrictions | Configure a different callback port |
| MFA not working | Misconfigured MFA, time synchronization issues | Verify MFA configuration, check device time |

## Configuration

The Authentication Module is configured through the client configuration file:

```toml

# Identity provider type (oauth2, oidc)
identity_provider = "oidc"

# OAuth2/OIDC configuration
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
oauth_url = "https://auth.example.com"
redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8085/callback"

# Token configuration
token_refresh_margin = 300  # seconds before expiry to refresh
token_storage = "encrypted_file"  # encrypted_file, keychain, or memory

# MFA configuration
require_mfa = true
mfa_remember_period = 86400  # seconds to remember MFA (24 hours)

# Session configuration
session_timeout = 28800  # seconds of inactivity before requiring re-auth (8 hours)
max_session_duration = 86400  # maximum session duration in seconds (24 hours)

# Browser configuration
browser_type = "system"  # system, custom, or none
custom_browser_path = ""  # path to custom browser executable
```

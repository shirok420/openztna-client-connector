# Architecture Overview

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the OpenZTNA Client Connector architecture, focusing on how it protects employee endpoints and secures access to enterprise resources.

## Zero Trust Architecture Principles

The OpenZTNA Client Connector implements core Zero Trust principles:

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every access request is fully authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Users receive only the minimum necessary access
3. **Assume Breach**: The architecture assumes breaches will happen and limits their impact
4. **Explicit Verification**: All resource access requires explicit verification
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Security is continuously assessed throughout sessions

## High-Level Architecture

The OpenZTNA Client Connector uses a modular architecture to create a secure gateway between employee devices and enterprise resources:

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication Module

The Authentication Module verifies user identity:

- **OAuth2/OIDC Integration**: Connects to identity providers
- **Token Management**: Securely handles authentication tokens
- **Single Sign-On**: Provides seamless authentication experience
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Supports additional verification factors
- **Session Management**: Maintains and refreshes authentication state

### 2. Device Assessment Engine

The Device Assessment Engine evaluates endpoint security:

- **OS Security Checks**: Verifies operating system security settings
- **Security Software Verification**: Confirms presence of required security tools
- **Patch Level Assessment**: Checks for critical security updates
- **Encryption Verification**: Ensures sensitive data is encrypted
- **Custom Security Policies**: Supports organization-specific security requirements

### 3. Tunneling Module

The Tunneling Module creates secure communication channels:

- **WireGuard Implementation**: Modern, efficient tunneling protocol
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secures all communications
- **Connection Resilience**: Maintains connectivity during network changes
- **Split Tunneling**: Selective routing of traffic
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimizes latency and overhead

### 4. Policy Enforcer

The Policy Enforcer applies access controls:

- **Policy Retrieval**: Gets policies from the control plane
- **Context-Aware Access**: Considers user, device, and environmental factors
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Provides access only when needed
- **Continuous Verification**: Regularly re-evaluates access permissions
- **Granular Controls**: Application-specific access rules

### 5. Local Proxy

The Local Proxy mediates application traffic:

- **Traffic Interception**: Captures application requests
- **Protocol Support**: Handles HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS
- **Transparent Operation**: Works with unmodified applications
- **Access Enforcement**: Blocks unauthorized requests
- **Traffic Routing**: Directs traffic through secure tunnels

## Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Approach

The Client Connector implements multiple security layers:

1. **User Authentication**: Verifies who is accessing resources
2. **Device Verification**: Ensures the device meets security requirements
3. **Encrypted Communications**: Protects data in transit
4. **Access Controls**: Enforces granular permissions
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Detects and responds to security changes

### Endpoint Protection

The Client Connector protects endpoints by:

- **Preventing Lateral Movement**: Isolating access to specific applications
- **Reducing Attack Surface**: Eliminating direct network exposure
- **Enforcing Security Policies**: Requiring compliance with security standards
- **Detecting Security Issues**: Identifying non-compliant devices
- **Securing Remote Access**: Protecting connections from any location

### Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected through:

- **Transport Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit
- **Access Controls**: Data is only accessible to authorized users
- **Device Verification**: Data is only accessible from secure devices
- **Session Controls**: Access is limited to active, authenticated sessions
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts are recorded

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates access to a protected resource
2. Client Connector redirects to identity provider
3. User authenticates with credentials and MFA
4. Identity provider issues authentication tokens
5. Client Connector securely stores tokens
6. Client Connector uses tokens for subsequent requests

### Resource Access Flow

1. Application sends request to protected resource
2. Local Proxy intercepts the request
3. Policy Enforcer checks access permissions
4. Device Assessment Engine verifies device security
5. Tunneling Module establishes secure connection
6. Request is forwarded to the protected resource
7. Response is returned through secure tunnel
8. Local Proxy delivers response to application

## Integration Architecture

### Control Plane Integration

The Client Connector communicates with the ZTNA control plane to:

- **Retrieve Policies**: Get access control policies
- **Report Status**: Send device security information
- **Establish Tunnels**: Set up secure communication channels
- **Authenticate Users**: Verify user identity
- **Receive Updates**: Get configuration changes

### Identity Provider Integration

The Client Connector integrates with identity providers through:

- **OAuth2/OIDC Protocols**: Standard authentication protocols
- **SAML Support**: Enterprise identity federation (planned)
- **Directory Services**: Integration with Active Directory/LDAP
- **MFA Integration**: Support for multi-factor authentication
- **SSO Capabilities**: Single sign-on across applications

### Application Integration

Applications connect to the Client Connector through:

- **Transparent Proxy**: Automatic traffic interception
- **Browser Integration**: Web traffic handling
- **SOCKS Proxy**: Support for non-HTTP protocols
- **API Integration**: Direct integration for custom applications
- **Split Tunneling**: Selective routing of application traffic

## Deployment Architecture

### Client Components

The Client Connector consists of:

- **Core Service**: Background process handling security functions
- **User Interface**: System tray/menu bar application
- **Browser Extension**: Optional component for web applications
- **Configuration Store**: Secure storage for settings
